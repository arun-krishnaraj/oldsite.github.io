My name's Arun, and I'm a rising Senior at UT Austin studying Computational Biology, Math, and Finance (this combo is admittedly uncommon, take a look at my rationale [here](https://arun-krishnaraj.github.io/Odd-Choices/)). After my time at UT, I plan on pursuing a graduate degree and career in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics. I started this site back in August 2020 while quarantined, and intend for it to serve a few important purposes:

The original intent of this site was to further my own learning. I'm a firm believer that the easiest way to verify your own knowledge on a subject is to teach it to others; if you fully know a topic, then you should be able to clearly articulate that to a novice. Obviously I don't have an audience of students willing to learn every topic I find remotely interesting, so I made do by creating the perception of an audience. Thanks to the Internet, this site exposes my knowledge to the world (at least potentially), and I find myself exploring topics with a much finer comb.

I quickly found that an additional use of this site is as a sort of repository for things I find interesting (essentially a blog). By crystallizing these things in words, I'm able to later reflect and build on them. So I use this site as a way to save snapshots of my stream of conscious, hopefully for my later use or simply mild amusement of my perceived audience.

The last use of the site is more straightforward: this site serves as a way to showcase my work, including academic writings, research projects, and other analysis (a digital CV or portfolio).

### Personal
In my free time I can usually be found in a coffee shop, at my desk, or outside. I'm quite fond of coffee. While the regular morning mug is appreciated, a late-night cup at an Austin local diner is unbeatable. I'm a big fan of video games of all types, and enjoy playing or watching other people play them. I also spend a good bit of time reading and building model kits. I enjoy anything that gets me outdoors, including running, hiking, and camping. As an undergrad, I'm involved in a student investment team, where I lead a data-science market intelligence division.

### Undergraduate Course Work
Here's some of the courses I've taken, organized by subject matter:
* Biostatistics, Genetics, Evolution, Organic Chemistry I, Microbiology, Microbial Genetics, Molecular Biology Lab, Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Biochemistry
* Multivariable Calculus, Probability I, Real Analysis, Number Theory, Linear Algebra, Applied Statistics
* Business Statistics, Statistics and Modeling for Finance, Business Finance, Investment Management, Financial Risk Management, Optimization Methods in Finance, Financial Analysis, Economic Principles of Decisions, Financial and Managerial Accounting, Financial Valuation
