### Notes

#### Lab 1
- 3 major experiments and 3 lab reports; read lab manual prior to lab section
- review of common units, dilution and solution calculations
- SI units:
  - combine common prefixes with base units
```{R}
library(knitr)
kable(data.frame("prefix" = c("deci","centi","milli","micro","nano","pico","femto","atto"), "Factor base 10" = c(-1,-2,-3,-6,-9,-12,-15,-18), "symbol" = c("d","c","m","mu","n","p","f","a"), "Prefix" = c("deca","hecto","kilo","mega","giga","tera","peta","exa"), "Factor base 10" = c(1,2,3,6,9,12,15,18), "symbol" = c("da","h","k","M","G","T","P","E")))
```

#### Lab 2

- goal of understanding water stress tolerance mechanisms in plants
- abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in stress-response signalling pathways
  - ABA is a terpene-based regulator, synthesized similarly to other steroids and lipids

#### 9/2/2020 Lecture
- Following a 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which caused massive amounts of destruction, several cases of Cholera popped up. Since Haiti had not had any lingering Cholera infections in the country, there was concern as cases seemed to crop up among a major waterway. Rapid sequence analysis revealed that the disease agent had come from Nepal with peacekeeping troops. Following accidental sewage system damage, Cholera was introduced to the watershed and spread further.
- Isle Royale, small island somewhat near mainland; low number of wolves present with natural prey of moose. Tend to come on and off the island using ice bridges; as a result of general warming, ice bridges became less frequent. Wolf genetic diversity plummeted due to inbreeding, causing severe population decline; wolves brought in from distinct populations to improve fitness.
- Papaya ringspot virus was completely eradicated in Hawaii by making papaya highly resistant to the virus

#### 9/2/2020 Lab
- Abscisic acid (ABA): major plant hormone, used in gene expression, signalling pathways. Can circumvent gene expression to directly interact with biomolecule for faster cellular response: rapid interaction with guard cells to close them in response to water loss.
- Arabinogalactan (AGP31 in Arabidopsis): glycoprotein in the cell wall. Use of Wild Type, AGP31 mutant, and AGP31 rescued Adabidopsis to see how plant response to Abscisic acid varied
- RNA Purification:
  - RNA experiment seeks to compare gene expression in wild type and two AGP31 altered transgenic lines when exposed to ABA in media
  - Use of mechanical force to grind seedling samples
  - Tissue lyser is used to rapidly grind sample material, kept at low temperature to avoid RNA degradation 
  - AGP31 rescued line occurs when wild gene copies are transferred to the knockout 
-Spectroscopic analysis of RNA samples
  - MS grow playes used to germinate Arabidopsis seeds
  - Nanodrop Spectrophotometer 
  
#### Lecture 9/9/2020

- ABA is almost ubiquitous in plants, serves several signalling functions
  - has also been found to play a role in signalling in some animal lineages
- most ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine) are changing genetically and shifting in response to anthropogenic climate change
  - experiment conducted on Arabidopsis shows promise of dought modified plant lines

  - first ABA-pathway deficient Arabidopsis grows poorly even when properly watered
- ABA pathway:
  - ABAR (PYR/PYL) receptor located in cytoplasm; under cellular dehydration, there will be a higher concentration of ABA in the cell (can be synthesized within the cell or transported from elsewhere)
    - PP2C: protein phosphatase (removed phospates from proteins), becomes bound to ABA ABAR complex
    - SnRK2: usually without phosphate due to PP2C activity; active in the phosphorylated form
      - adds phosphates to target proteins
    - AB15: activated by SnRK2 phosphorylation
    - SLAC1/anion transport group is also activated by SnRK2 phosphorylation
    
#### Lab 9/9/2020
- What did we do last week?
  - purified RNA from seedlings treated with ABA or control, then determine RNA quality using spectroscopic analysis and electrophoresis 
- cDNA synthesis: use purified RNA in reverse transcription to produce complementary DNA
  - thermostable DNA pol requires a DNA template to synthesize DNA; we use RNA to produce cDNA to make a template for synthesis
    - we prepare samples that are both +RT and -RT (control samples)
    - incubate with DNAse to reduce any contaminating genomic DNA still present; DNase is then inactivated
      - DNase will not be 100% comoplete, some residual genomic DNA will be present and be used as a template for DNA; we need -RT samples to quantify this effect
    - 
- we need to determine with primers for Arabidopsis *OLE1* gene expression show acceptable properties for use in qPCR
