### Condensed Notes

#### Chapter 2: Mendel's Principles of Heredity
##### 2.1 The Puzzle of Inheritance

- artificial selection was the first example of application of genetic principles
- Mendel chose and appropriate model organism, and observed discrete traits

##### 2.2 Genetic Analysis according to Mendel

- Monohybrid crosses result in uniform $F_1$ and a ratio of 3:1 in $F_2$ of yellow to green; indicates that yellow was dominant and green was recessive, different genes had varying alleles
- law of segregation: each gamete receives a single parent allele and unite at random during fertilization
  - Mendel's results illustrate sum and product rules
- test crosses to homozygous recessive to determine genotype
- law of independent assortment: alleles segregate independently of each other, shown by dihybrid crosses
- molecular influence dtermines whether allels are dominant or recessive, as well as phenotypic effect

##### 2.3 Mendelian Inheritance in Humans

- Family history or pedigree is used by geneticists
- can only be applied to single gene traits
- vertical patterns indicate dominant, horizontal indicate recessive

#### Chapter3: Extensions to Mendel's Laws

##### 3.1 Extensions for single-gene Inheritance

- incomplete dominance is when progeny looks like neither parent
- co-dominance is when progeny looks like both parents
- a gene may have many alleles, dominance is relative to second allele
- mutations are the source of new alleles
- wild type alleles (+) are the most common (>1%)
  - other alleles are considered mutant
  - polymorphic alles have multiple wild types 
- a single fene contributing to many charcteristics is pleiotropy 
- an allele that negatively impacts survival of homozygotes is a recessive lethal allele (AY mice)
  - delayed onset of lethality can allow deleterious alleles to be passed on
  
##### 3.2 Extension to Mendel for Two-Gene Inheritance
- certain genes can be additively controlled by two independently assorting genes
- Epistasis: when one gene masks the effects of alleles at another gene
  - Recessive epistasis: homozygous recessive masks both alleles of another gene (9:3:4)
  - Reciprocal recessive epistasis: homozygous recessive of each gene masks the dominant allele of the other gene (9:7)
  - Dominant epistasis I: dominant allele of one gene masks both alleles of another gene (12:3:1)
  - Dominant epistasis II: dominant allele of one gene masks effects of dominant allele of other gene (13:3)
  - Redundancy: one dominant allele at either of two genes is necessary for proper function (15:1)
- locus heterogeneity: mutation in any of two or more genes results in the same phenotype
- using complementation test, we can find if mutations reside in the same gene: isolate large number of independent mutants and cross

##### 3.3 Extensions to Mendel for Multi-factorial Inheritance
- penetrance: proportion of individuals with a genotype that shows expected phenotype
- expressivity: the degree to which a phenotype is expressed (variable or unvarying)
- modifier genes: alter phenotypes produced by alleles of other genes to a secondary degree
- environmental influences can cause changes in phenotype
  - conditional lethals can be activated by environmental factors
  - phenocopy: change in phenotype as a result of environmental agents mimicking the effects of gene mutation
  
#### Chapter 4: The Chromosome Theory of Inheritance
##### 4.1 The carriers of genes
- Leeuwenhoek: observed spermatozoa, sperm and eggs are the only elements contributing equally to zygote formation
- gametes and other single set: haploid vs zygotes and autosomes (diploid)
- homologs: chromosomes that contain the same set of genes

##### 4.2 Sex chromosomes and sex determination
- sex chromosomes: two distinct chromosomes that provide the basis of sex determination
  - in humans, the SRY gene determines maleness, confirmed by sex reversal studies
- species vary in sex determination mechanisms (XY where female is homogametic, ZW where male is homogametic)

##### 4.3 Mitosis: Cell division that preserves chromosom number
- most of cell life: mass of chromatin in nuclear envelope
- Interphase
  - $G_1$, S (DNA synthesis and chromosomal replication), $G_2$
- Mitosis
  - prophase: chromosome condenses in nuclear envelope, sister chromatids are connected at their centromeres
  - prometaphase: nuclear envelope breaks down, microtubules attach to chromatids
    - mitotic spindle: kinetochore, polar and astral microtubules
  - metaphase: chromosomes align on the metaphase plate with sister chromatids facing opposite poles
  - anaphase: connection between centromeres is severed, chromatids move to opposite poles
  - telophase: nuclear membranes re-form, spindle fibers disappear
  - cytokinesis: contractile ring or cell plate divides the cells, can be delayed to create multi-nucleated animal cells (syncytium)
- regulatory checkpoints ensure correct chromosome separation, duplication, alignment at metaphase plate

##### 4.4 Meiosis: cell divisions that halve chromosome number
- chromosomes replicate once but nucleus divides twice
- Meiosis I (Reductional Division): homologs pair, chromosomes replicate, exchange parts
  - Prophase I: chromatin condenses, pairing of homologous chromosomes
    - Leptotene: long, thin chromosomes begin to thicken
    - zygotene: each chromosome seeks its homolog and is connected through synapsis (using the protein synaptonemal complex)
    - pachytene: recombination nodules exchange parts between nonsister chromatides
    - diplotene: dissolution of synaptonemal complex and slight separation of homologous chromosomes, remain tightly merged along their chiasmata (cross over site)
    - diakinesis: further condensation of the chromatids, the end of diakinesis is the same as prometaphase
  - Metaphase I: paired homologs are attached by spindle poles at their kinetochore (random assortment)
  - Anaphase I: homologs are separated, sister chromatids remain attached
  - Telophase I: nuclear membranesform around separated chromosomes, cytokinesis
  - Interkinesis I: decondensation then re-condensation without replication
