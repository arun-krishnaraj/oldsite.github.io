### Condensed Notes

#### Chapter 2: Mendel's Principles of Heredity
##### 2.1 The Puzzle of Inheritance

- artificial selection was the first example of application of genetic principles
- Mendel chose and appropriate model organism, and observed discrete traits

##### 2.2 Genetic Analysis according to Mendel

- Monohybrid crosses result in uniform $F_1$ and a ratio of 3:1 in $F_2$ of yellow to green; indicates that yellow was dominant and green was recessive, different genes had varying alleles
- law of segregation: each gamete receives a single parent allele and unite at random during fertilization
  - Mendel's results illustrate sum and product rules
- test crosses to homozygous recessive to determine genotype
- law of independent assortment: alleles segregate independently of each other, shown by dihybrid crosses
- molecular influence dtermines whether allels are dominant or recessive, as well as phenotypic effect

##### 2.3 Mendelian Inheritance in Humans

- Family history or pedigree is used by geneticists
- can only be applied to single gene traits
- vertical patterns indicate dominant, horizontal indicate recessive

#### Chapter3: Extensions to Mendel's Laws

##### 3.1 Extensions for single-gene Inheritance

- incomplete dominance is when progeny looks like neither parent
- co-dominance is when progeny looks like both parents
- a gene may have many alleles, dominance is relative to second allele
- mutations are the source of new alleles
- wild type alleles (+) are the most common (>1%)
  - other alleles are considered mutant
  - polymorphic alles have multiple wild types 
- a single fene contributing to many charcteristics is pleiotropy 
- an allele that negatively impacts survival of homozygotes is a recessive lethal allele (AY mice)
  - delayed onset of lethality can allow deleterious alleles to be passed on
  
##### 3.2 Extension to Mendel for Two-Gene Inheritance
- certain genes can be additively controlled by two independently assorting genes
- Epistasis: when one gene masks the effects of alleles at another gene
  - Recessive epistasis: homozygous recessive masks both alleles of another gene (9:3:4)
  - Reciprocal recessive epistasis: homozygous recessive of each gene masks the dominant allele of the other gene (9:7)
  - Dominant epistasis I: dominant allele of one gene masks both alleles of another gene (12:3:1)
  - Dominant epistasis II: dominant allele of one gene masks effects of dominant allele of other gene (13:3)
  - Redundancy: one dominant allele at either of two genes is necessary for proper function (15:1)
- locus heterogeneity: mutation in any of two or more genes results in the same phenotype
- using complementation test, we can find if mutations reside in the same gene: isolate large number of independent mutants and cross

##### 3.3 Extensions to Mendel for Multi-factorial Inheritance
- penetrance: proportion of individuals with a genotype that shows expected phenotype
- expressivity: the degree to which a phenotype is expressed (variable or unvarying)
- modifier genes: alter phenotypes produced by alleles of other genes to a secondary degree
- environmental influences can cause changes in phenotype
  - conditional lethals can be activated by environmental factors
  - phenocopy: change in phenotype as a result of environmental agents mimicking the effects of gene mutation
  
#### Chapter 4: The Chromosome Theory of Inheritance
##### 4.1 The carriers of genes
- Leeuwenhoek: observed spermatozoa, sperm and eggs are the only elements contributing equally to zygote formation
- gametes and other single set: haploid vs zygotes and autosomes (diploid)
- homologs: chromosomes that contain the same set of genes

##### 4.2 Sex chromosomes and sex determination
- sex chromosomes: two distinct chromosomes that provide the basis of sex determination
  - in humans, the SRY gene determines maleness, confirmed by sex reversal studies
- species vary in sex determination mechanisms (XY where female is homogametic, ZW where male is homogametic)

##### 4.3 Mitosis: Cell division that preserves chromosom number
- most of cell life: mass of chromatin in nuclear envelope
- Interphase
  - $G_1$, S (DNA synthesis and chromosomal replication), $G_2$
- Mitosis
  - prophase: chromosome condenses in nuclear envelope, sister chromatids are connected at their centromeres
  - prometaphase: nuclear envelope breaks down, microtubules attach to chromatids
    - mitotic spindle: kinetochore, polar and astral microtubules
  - metaphase: chromosomes align on the metaphase plate with sister chromatids facing opposite poles
  - anaphase: connection between centromeres is severed, chromatids move to opposite poles
  - telophase: nuclear membranes re-form, spindle fibers disappear
  - cytokinesis: contractile ring or cell plate divides the cells, can be delayed to create multi-nucleated animal cells (syncytium)
- regulatory checkpoints ensure correct chromosome separation, duplication, alignment at metaphase plate

##### 4.4 Meiosis: cell divisions that halve chromosome number
- chromosomes replicate once but nucleus divides twice
- Meiosis I (Reductional Division): homologs pair, chromosomes replicate, exchange parts
  - Prophase I: chromatin condenses, pairing of homologous chromosomes
    - Leptotene: long, thin chromosomes begin to thicken
    - zygotene: each chromosome seeks its homolog and is connected through synapsis (using the protein synaptonemal complex)
    - pachytene: recombination nodules exchange parts between nonsister chromatides
    - diplotene: dissolution of synaptonemal complex and slight separation of homologous chromosomes, remain tightly merged along their chiasmata (cross over site)
    - diakinesis: further condensation of the chromatids, the end of diakinesis is the same as prometaphase
  - Metaphase I: paired homologs are attached by spindle poles at their kinetochore (random assortment)
  - Anaphase I: homologs are separated, sister chromatids remain attached
  - Telophase I: nuclear membranesform around separated chromosomes, cytokinesis
  - Interkinesis: decondensation then re-condensation without replication
- Meiosis II (Equational Division): sister chromatids separate to produce haploid gametes
  - Prophase II: chromosomes re-condense, nuclear envelope breaks down, spindle apparatus reforms
  - Metaphase II: sister chromatid pairs align at metaphase plate
  - Anaphase II: junction of connection between sister centromeres is severed, sister chromatids move to poles
  - Telophase II: nuclear membrane reforms, cytokinesis 
- segregational errors in meiosis produce defective gametes, such as trisomy through nondisjunction
- meiosis contributes to genetic diversity: mixing of parental genes, genetic reshuffling

##### 4.6 Validation of the Chromosome Theory
- Mendel's laws correlate to chromosome behavior in meiosis
- sex morphology is associated with inheritance of particular chromosomes
- specific traits are transmitted on specific chromosomes 
  - traits can be sex linked (hemizygous; eye color gene in flies)
  - nondisjunction analysis validates chromosomal theory
  
##### 4.7 Sex-Linked and Sexually dimorphic traits in humans
- X-linked recessive 
  - appears in males more than females
  - never passed from father to son
  - affected males make carrier daughters
  - often skips generations
- X-linked dominant
  - appears in more females than males
  - all daughters but no sons of an affected male will be affected
- Y-linked trais
  - only seen in males
  - all male descendants of an affected male will be affected
- in XX, human females, one X chromosome is inactivated, and condenses into a Barr Body

#### Chapter 5: Linkage, Recombination, Mapping
##### 5.1 Gene Linkage and Recombination
- some genes on the same chromosome do not assort independently, instead they are linked
  - linked genes will favor parental classes over recombinants
- specific gene-pairs have degrees of linkage
- test cross can be use to find linked genes

##### 5.2 Recombination
- as a result of crossing over, chromatids exchange information reciprocally
- frequency of recombination increases with distance between genes
  - recombination frequency can be 50% max in unlinked genes

##### 5.3 Mapping
- by using a linear form, gene order and distance can be found
- due to limitations of two-point crosses, 3-point are generally more useful
  - distance is percentage of recombinants, adding double cross recombinants twice
- chromosomal interference, a crossover event reduces probability of additional crossovers
- $\text{interference} = 1 - \text{Coefficient of incidence}$, where $\text{coefficient of incidence} = \frac{\text{observed}}{\text{expected}}$
- RF underestimated crossover frequency: at some point distance no longer increases RF past 50%

##### 5.4 The Chi-Squared Test
- use $\chi^2$ for data significance 
  - frame null hypothesis for refutation $\sum\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$
  - degrees of freedom is $\# \text{ of classes} -1$
  
#### Chapter 6: DNA Structure, Replication, Recombination
##### 6.1 Experimental Evidence
- DNA is nucleotides connected by phosphodiester bonds
- DNA is the agent of transformation in the S.R bacteria studies
- heavy P and S bacteriophage experiments confirm DNA as instructions for cellular propagation

##### 6.2 Watson and Crick Double Helix Model
- Nucleotides: deoxyribose, phosphate, nitrogenous base (purin or pyrimidine)
- DNA is anti-parallel, and is mostly right-handed $\beta$-DNA, with major and minor grooves
  - some occurs as $\zeta$ form DNA: left-handed spiral and zigzags in helix backbone
- most nuclear chromosomes are long, linear, double strands, but some smaller chromosomes are circular (prokaryotes, organelles, viruses)
- some viruses exhibit single-strandedness prior to replication and expression

##### 6.3 Genetics Information in Nucleotide Sequences
- most genetic information is read from unwound DNA, but some if accessible through the grooves
- RNA uses ribose and Uracil instead of deoxyribose and thymine
  - can fold upon itself in complex manners
  
##### 6.4 DNA replication
- complementary base pairing ensures semi-conservative replication
  - verified by heavy nitrogen experiments
- DNA pol uses high energy bonds of dNTPs to form new phosphodiester bonds
  - requires:
    - 4 dNTPs
    - single strand template, pol moves 5' - 3' 
    - primer with free 3' OH, since DNA pol can only add to 3' end, a primer must establish the first link
- Replication
  - Initiation
    - unwinding of double helix at origin (initiator protein, helicase), formation of replication forks; initiator protein attracts helicase, opening up Y regions (replication forks)
    - DNA pol II adds nucleotides 5'-3' on top of primers laid by primase
  - Elongation
    - DNA pol III catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides 
    - leading strand continuously synthesized 5'-3'
    - lagging strand synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki tragments initiated by RNA primers
      - DNA pol I replaces RNA on lagging strand and ligase seals nicks
    - in circular chromosomes (covalently closed), supercoiling resulting from local unwinding must be eased by topoisomerase
  - Telomeres ensure accurate replication at ends of chromosome
  - Genetic fidelity is ensured by redundancy, precision of cellular replication

##### 6.5 Homologous Recombination
- recombination is the reciprocal genetic exchange between homologs
  - takes place at the 4-strand stage
- molecular model of crossover
  - 1) Double-strand break formation: SPO11 cleaves phosphodiester bonds
  - 2) Resection: exonuclease degrades 5' ends on each side of the break
  - 3) First strand invasion: Dmc1 helps strand invade to form a heteroduplex and D-loop
  - 4) Formation of a double Holliday junction: DNA is added and ligated to rejoin strands
  - 5) Branch migration: lengthening of the heteroduplex region
  - 6) Resolution of the double Holliday Junction: nicks created by resolvase and ligation
- DNA repair of heteroduplexes can result in gene conversion (one allele is double repair template)

#### Chapter 7: Anatomy and Function of a Gene
##### 7.1 Mutations
- forward mutations: changes wild-type, can be dominant or recessive
- reserve mutations reverse novel mutant to wild-type allele
- mutations can be classified as substitutions (transition or transversion), deletion, or insertion
- average mutation rate is low, but varies for each gene
  - multi-cellular organisms have higher mutation rate than bacteria
  - disruptive mutation is much more common than reversive
  - most human mutation arises from sperm
- mutation occurs by change: Luria-Delbrück fluctuation experiment

##### 7.2 Molecular Mechanisms that Alter DNA sequence
- there must be no repair of mistakes or damage for mutation to occur
- depurination: hydrolysis of a purin base
- deamination: conversion of cytosine to uracil
- X-rays break DNA backbones, resulting in deletion
- UV light: thymine dimers
- oxidation: active oxidated base species mispairs (Pur-Pur/Pyr-Pyr)
- mistakes in DNA replication cause mutations
  - DNA pol uses 3'-5' exonuclease function to excise base mispairings
    - can make mistakes due to base tautomerization (tautomeric form changes base pairings)
  - unstable trinucleotides can expand or contract due to slipped pairings
    - when DNA pol pauses at repeat sequences, one of the strands can slip
- Mutagens can induce mutations
  - base analogs (5-Bromouracil pairs to A or G)
  - hydroxylating agents (C* pairs to A)
  - Alylating agents (G* pairs to T)
  - Deaminating agents (C $\rightarrow$ U, A $\rightarrow$ Hypoxanthine (pairs to C))
  - Intercalcators: proflavin causes single insertions and deletions
- Use of Ames test to determine carcinogenicity of mutagenic compounds and their metabolites
  - tests HIS$^-$ mutant bacteria for recombination

##### 7.3 DNA Repear Mechanisms
- some DNA damage can be repaired (alkyl transferase, photolyase)
- Damaged bases can be removed and replaced by using the other strand
  - Base-excision repair: glycosylases remove altered bases, AP site is cut by endonuclease, exonucleases rescect site, pol fills gap, ligation
  - nucleotide excision repair: UvrA + UvrB look for thymine dimers, UvrB + UvrC cut on either side, pol fills gap and ligation
  - two methods of repairing double-strand breaks
    - 1) Homologous Repair (HR): use of homolog or sister chromatid as template
    - 2) Nonhomologous End Joining (NHEJ): protein protects ends and brings them together for ligation
      - can result in large deletions or inversions if >1 double strand break exists
      - often results in small additions or deletions at the broken ends
  - methyl-directed mismatch repair: parental methyl tags are recognized by MutS and MutC to repair new strand
- error-prone repair system
  - SOS bacterial system: sloppy DNA pol inserts random nucleotides
  - Microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ): similar to NHEJ, but both sides of the break are resected prior to ligation, results in large deletions
- mutation of DNA repair systems results in disease
- DNA repair cannot be 100% efficient; mutation is the raw material of evolution

##### 7.4 What mutation tells us about gene function
- complementation testing reveals whether two mutations are in a single gene
  - complementation occurs when an individual is heterozygous for mutations at 2 genes
  - complementation group: mutations that do not complement each other
- recombination within a gene can result in a wild type
- use of E. Coli $(\lambda)$
  - cannot be lysated (from plaque) by rII$^-$ mutants
  - if two mutants recombine within a gene, $\lambda$ will form plaques
  - $RF = \frac{2[\text{number of plaques on E. Coli K}(\lambda)]}{[\text{number of plaques on E. Coli B}]}$

##### 7.5 Genes
- a gene contains info for a specific enzyme: one gene, one enzyme hypothesis
  - autotroph and prototroph experiments support one gene, one enzyme hypothesis
- genes specify identity and order of amino acids in polypeptide chains
  - 20 common amino acids
  - first end synthesized is N terminus, last is C terminus
  - mutations can alter amino acid sequences (missense mutation)
- amino acid sequence dictates a protein's three-dimensional structure
  - primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary structures (multimeric proteins only, multiple subunits interact)
