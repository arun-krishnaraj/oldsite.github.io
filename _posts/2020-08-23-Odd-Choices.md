excerpt: "Why do I have such an odd combo of majors?"
---

When faced with the routine "What major are you?" question, my answer tends to be incomplete. I rarely give a full answer, not out of secrecy, conceit, or regret, but in an attempt to avoid explanation and self-reflection. A full answer usually begets a follow-on question on my motivation for making such a choice, a complicated answer that rattles on for too long, undoubtedly boring the listener. In a selfish attempt to avoid such awkwardness, I usually provide a partial answer. Interestingly, I've chosen to devote an entire post to the subject, likely since boring a virtual audience is decidedly more palatable.

There are a staggering number of subjects available for study at any modern university, and students are encouraged to explore a wide variety before committing to specialization. There's an understandable difficulty in making this choice; doing so effectively sets the stage for what's plausible down the line. Mostly owing to the chunk of coursework excised by high school credits, I found myself fortunate enough to reject the choice, and instead pursue three distinct paths.

To be clear, I'm not the only one on this path; many peers, especially those coming from high schools where advanced courses abound, have chosen to pursue even more paths. Interestingly, most of these combinations seem to be fairly conventional and sensible at a glance; combinations of computer science and math, or economics and finance seem intuitively useful. I would be remiss to claim that such combinations don't offer valuable synergies in skillset and knowledge.

Then that onto the central question, why did I choose this seemingly arbitrary lot?

If you've explored this site at all, you've probably reached the conclusion that I enjoy applications of statistics. Indeed among all the maths, I find statistics the both the most interesting and applicable. So that explains the major in mathematics.

As statisticians of all levels will attest, problems benefitting from an intimate knowledge of statistical methods can be found in every subject. Whether humanities, physical science, business, or engineering, problems of uncertainty are everywhere. I argue that those who explore this diversity are able to further develop their intuition and expand their toolbox.

As the name likely implies, studies in quantitative finance are essentially applications of stats. In addition to offering a new set of problems to expand my abilities, studying finance has allowed me to deeper explore my long-time interest in financial markets.

Now the last subject, the one which I devote most of my time to, computational biology (it should be apparent that this too is an application of stats). Though I strongly believe that exposure to a variety of problems is helpful, eventually one must make a choice of the path they take; to my consternation it is infeasible to spend a lifetime learning everything. Throughout undergrad I became more and more enamored with applications of stats in biology, which eventually dominated my grad school choices. There's something deeply alluring about using quantitative methods to understand life itself; it's quite shocking that of things understood, life and its associated processes are often the least-so. The field has so much left to understand despite its age, no doubt owing to the staggering complexity of the problems faced. Such problems are the most interesting to explore and gratifying to complete, not to mention invaluable and incredibly impactful.

So that's the answer I try so hard to avoid giving: I'm just interested in finding new problems to work on. If I had to do it again I might have made a different choice, but I'm by no means unhappy with this path. Sunk costs aside, this unconventional path has allowed me to explore a number of interesting questions, grow intellectually and personally, and meet a lot of great people on the way. Hopefully this provides some clarity on my choice, as well as motivates the reader to find new and interesting problems to explore.
